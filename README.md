## Session Description
Research showed that since the passage of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) in 2001, school districts have primarily used student data for accountability purposes, with only limited use of these data to inform classroom instruction. Yet the recent proliferation of web-based tools to access school- and district-level data has led many to believe that this should change—that there should be increased use of data to inform work at all levels, from the district central office to the classroom. For instance, classroom teachers can integrate data into the PDSA process by using student performance data to guide classroom instruction, evaluate the effectiveness of chosen curriculum, and ultimately improve student achievement. FCPS’s dashboard is designed to be user friendly though teachers may have different opinions. Thus, the purpose of this presentation is to demystify the nuts and bolts of the data dashboard to assist in teaching and learning.
